#  How did Manchester United FC perform in the 2022 World Cup?

 Manchester United FC, a professional football club in England, competed in the 2022 World Cup. The team was eliminated in the group stage after losing to two other top-tier teams.

The Red Devils opened their campaign with a 1-0 loss to Mexico. They then followed that up with another defeat, this time to Brazil by a score of 3-1. Their final match was against Japan, and they were unable to find the back of the net, resulting in a 0-0 draw that led to their elimination from the competition.

While the results themselves were not ideal, there were some positives that can be taken away from United's performance in Qatar. One such positive was the play of Paul Pogba, who showed why he is considered one of the best midfielders in the world.
