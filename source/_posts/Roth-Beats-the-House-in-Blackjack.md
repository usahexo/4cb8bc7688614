#  Roth Beats the House in Blackjack

In the popular casino game blackjack, the objective of the player is to beat the dealer by achieving a hand total of 21 or less, without going over 21. In a game with perfect basic strategy, Roth beats the house with a probability of 0.5471%.

Roth starts by placing an initial bet, and then receives two cards. The house also receives two cards; one face up and one face down. Players must take turns drawing additional cards to their hand until they either reach 21 or go over. The aim is to beat the dealer's hand without busting (going over 21).

If the player's first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card (called a "blackjack"), they win automatically unless the dealer also has a blackjack, in which case it's a push. If the Roth Busts on his turn then he loses regardless of what the dealers cards are.

To calculate how likely Roth is to win against the dealer, assume that each possible outcome of the hand is equally likely. That is, each time Roth draws another card, his chances of winning are unchanged. With this assumption, we can determine the probability that Roth'll have a better hand than the dealer:
There are 18 possible outcomes when Roth takes another card (10 possible winning outcomes and 8 losing outcomes), so the probability that Roth beats the dealer is:
P(Roth Beats Dealer) = 1 - P(Roth Busts Dealer) = 0.5471%

#  Roth Wins Hands Down in Blackjack

There are different strategies that can be used when playing blackjack in order to give yourself the best chance of winning. One of these is the Roth strategy, which has been shown to provide players with a significant advantage over other strategies.

The Roth strategy is a relatively simple one which involves always splitting pairs of eights and aces, and always doubling down on 11. This gives players a better chance of getting 21 than if they were to follow any other strategy.

There are a number of reasons why the Roth strategy is so successful. Firstly, by splitting pairs of eights and aces, players are more likely to get two hands that can score points. Secondly, by doubling down on 11, players are increasing their chances of getting 21 – something that pays out more heavily than any other hand in blackjack.

It is worth noting that the Roth strategy does come with a few risks attached. Players who follow this strategy may find themselves busting more often than those who don’t. However, as long as players are comfortable with these risks, the Roth strategy can be a very effective way to improve their chances of winning at blackjack.
