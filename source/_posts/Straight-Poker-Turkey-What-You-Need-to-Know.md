If you’re looking for a new casino game that requires some skill and offers the potential for big payouts, you may want to try your hand at straight poker turkey. This popular variation of traditional poker is becoming increasingly popular, thanks to its exciting gameplay and generous payouts. In this article, we’ll teach you the basics of the game so that you can start playing today.

In straight poker turkey, players are dealt five cards each, and must make the best possible hand using any combination of those cards. The goal is to beat the dealer’s hand, or else risk losing your bet. The deck comprises of 52 cards, including 2 jokers which act as wildcards. There are a number of different winning hands in poker turkey, and we’ll run through them in detail below.

The most common winning hand in poker turkey is four of a kind, which pays out 9-1 on your bet. A flush – five cards of the same suit – pays out 6-1, while a straight (five consecutive cards) pays out 3-1. If you get three of a kind, that pays out 2-1, and two pair pays 1-1. Finally, if you just have one card that matches the dealer’s, that’s called a ‘pat hand’ and it pays out even money.

One important thing to note about poker turkey is that the rank of hands is different from traditional poker. In other words, a royal flush – Ace high through 10 high – is not the highest possible hand; instead it ranks as fifth highest.

#  What is a Straight Poker Turkey and How Do I Make One?

A straight poker turkey is a variation of the Texas Hold'em game in which the player can choose to play as a normal turkey or as a straight turkey. In order to make a straight poker turkey, the player must first place an ante and then place a bet. After that, they will be dealt five cards. The player can either keep their cards or exchange them for new ones. If they keep their cards, then they will have to choose two of them to use as their poker hand. If they exchange their cards, then they will automatically get two new cards. After that, the player will have to either fold or raise. If they fold, then they will lose their ante and any bets that were placed. If they raise, then the other players will have to do the same. The last player standing will win the pot.

#  How to Roast a Perfect Straight Poker Turkey

The turkey is the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving feast. It can be a daunting task to roast a perfect turkey, but with some simple tips, anyone can do it.

To start, you will need a whole turkey, preferably one that is 12-16 pounds. Make sure to thaw the turkey completely before beginning.

Next, you will need to preheat your oven to 425 degrees F.

In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Rub this mixture all over the outside of the turkey.

Using kitchen string or skewers, truss the legs and wings of the turkey together. This will help keep them in place while cooking.

If using a roasting pan with a wire rack insert, set the turkey on it breast-side down. If not using a roasting pan with a wire rack insert, place the turkey in a large deep baking dish. Fill up the dish around the bird with 1-2 cups of chicken broth or water to help prevent sticking and promote even cooking.

Roast the turkey in the oven for 45 minutes at 425 degrees F. Then Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F and continue roasting for an additional 2-3 hours (or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F). Baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so with pan drippings (if using a roasting pan with wire rack insert) or chicken broth/water from the baking dish (if not using a roasting pan with wire rack insert).


Once your turkey has reached 165 degrees F internally, remove it from the oven and allow it to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving. Carve your perfect Thanksgiving feast!

The best part of this dish is that it's incredibly simple to make. You just need some basic ingredients like butter, garlic, salt, pepper and chicken broth. First, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.
