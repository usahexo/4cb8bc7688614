The online gaming industry is expanding with every day. Games of all types are being developed for the web and mobile devices. Casino games, arcade games, first person shooters, strategy games, and more can now be played online with others from around the world.

One of the most important aspects of any online game is the ability to set a cool down. This prevents players from abusing features or gameplay mechanics in order to gain an unfair advantage over their opponents. In many cases, a cool down period is also required in order to prevent players from repeatedly quitting and rejoining matches in an attempt to avoid defeat.

When it comes to setting a cool down for online games, Revlo is one of the best options available. Revlo is a social media platform that allows gamers to earn rewards for participating in various activities such as streaming on Twitch, subscribing to channels, watching ads, and more. These rewards can then be used to purchase in-game items or bonuses.

Revlo offers developers a wide range of tools that they can use to customize their games. This includes the ability to set a cool down period for any action that can be performed in-game. The following guide will show you how to set a cool down using Revlo’s developer tools.

First, navigate to the Developer Console page on the Revlo website. This page can be found by clicking on the “Console” tab at the top of the page.

Under Cooldown Time , enter the number of seconds that you would like to set as your cooldown timer .


In this example, we will set a cooldown timer of 10 seconds .


Under Should Cooldown Prevent Quitting? , select whether you want players to be able to quit out of your game during cooldown periods . In most cases , you will want players to be able to quit so they can take breaks without penalty . However , if you want players to be unable to quit during cooldown periods , select “ yes ” .
