#  What are the global trends in home and kitchen appliances?

The global trends in home and kitchen appliances are changing every year. In the past, people would purchase large appliances like dishwashers and refrigerators. However, now it is becoming more popular to purchase smaller appliances that serve a specific function, like a juicer or a blender. This is because many people are living in smaller spaces and do not have the room for large appliances.

Another trend in home and kitchen appliances is the use of smart technology. Smart appliances can be controlled through mobile apps or voice commands, which makes them easier to use. Additionally, they can often be connected to other devices in your home, such as your heating and cooling system, so that you can control them all from one place.

The style of home appliances is also changing. In the past, most appliances were white or stainless steel, but now there are a variety of colours and finishes to choose from. This allows you to match your appliances with your decor or personality.

If you are looking for new home or kitchen appliances, be sure to keep these global trends in mind.
