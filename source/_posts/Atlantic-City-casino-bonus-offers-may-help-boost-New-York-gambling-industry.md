#  Atlantic City casino bonus offers may help boost New York gambling industry

Atlantic City casino bonus offers may help boost New York gambling industry, as state officials look to expand gaming options in the Empire State.

According to a recent report in the <em>New York Post</em>, lawmakers are weighing a proposal that would allow up to seven new casinos to open in New York, with at least one of those facilities located in the New York City area. The measure is seen as a way to help shore up the state’s struggling gambling industry, which has seen revenues decline in recent years.

Casino bonus offers could play a role in boosting New York gambling industry revenues. In addition to the possibility of new casinos, lawmakers are also considering expanding gambling options at existing venues, including racetracks and OTBs (off-track betting locations). This could include introducing new games such as poker and blackjack, as well as permitting video lottery terminals (VLTs) at additional locations.

The potential for expanded gambling in New York has already sparked interest from casino operators, including MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Both companies have reportedly expressed an interest in building new casinos in the Empire State.

If approved, the expansion of gambling in New York would come on the heels of similar moves in other states. In Massachusetts, for example, lawmakers are currently considering a proposal that would allow up to three resort-style casinos and one slots parlor to open in the Bay State. And just last week, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed a bill allowing for construction of up to 10 new casinos across the state.

New York lawmakers have recently proposed a gambling expansion bill that would allow for the construction of new casinos in the state. The proposal was announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday and it is said that the measure would bring in $1.5 billion in new revenue for the state. In addition, the bill would also allow for the expansion of racetracks with video lottery terminals and it would also legalize online poker.

Governor Cuomo commented on the proposal, stating that it would “bring jobs and economic growth to upstate New York”. He went on to say that the measure is part of his broader goal to create a “second economic revolution” in upstate New York. The proposal has already been met with some criticism, however, as opponents argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates.

If approved, the measure would allow for six new casinos to be built in different areas of upstate New York. The casinos would be located in Albany, Binghamton, Elmira, Niagara Falls, Syracuse, and Troy. In addition, four existing racetracks with video lottery terminals would be allowed to expand their operations. Finally, online poker would be legalized in the state under the new proposal.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. They note that casino gambling is already prevalent in New York and that this measure would simply allow for more casinos to be constructed. Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. They also note that there are already many casinos located in New York and that this measure will only serve to cannibalize business from those establishments.

#  Upstate New York casinos see potential in legalized gambling

Albany, NY - There is big potential for upstate New York casinos, as the state moves closer to legalizing gambling.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow for seven new full-scale casinos to be built in Upstate New York. The amendment would also allow for 40 new mini-casinos, or racinos, to be built across the state.

Cuomo said that the amendment would bring in $1 billion in new revenue to the state each year. He cited studies that showed that legalized gambling would create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity statewide.

"It is time to bringing this economic development opportunity to Upstate New York," Cuomo said. "This proposal will create jobs and generate billions of dollars for our economy."

The amendment needs to be approved by the legislature in two successive sessions and then by voters in a referendum. The earliest it could go before voters is November 2019.

Casino operators are already expressing interest in building casinos in Upstate New York. MGM Resorts has already announced plans to build a casino resort in Sullivan County, while Caesars Entertainment has said it is interested in building a casino in Schenectady County.

Others are more cautious about the potential of legalized gambling. Upstate New York Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Heather Briccetti said that the chamber wants to see more details about the proposal before taking a position on it.

"There are certainly pros and cons to any type of development project, and we want to make sure that any expansion of gaming includes opportunities for businesses throughout all regions of the state," Briccetti said.

#  Could casino bonus lead to legalization of gambling in New York?

A recent study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has found that introducing a bonus for casino players could lead to an increase in the legalization of gambling across the United States. The study, which was published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, looked at how different casino bonuses influenced people’s attitudes towards gambling and their intention to gamble in the future.

The researchers found that people who received a bonus were more likely to have a positive attitude towards gambling and to be more likely to gamble in the future. In fact, the study showed that around 60% of those who received a bonus said they were likely to gamble in the future, compared to just 40% of those who didn’t receive a bonus. The researchers also found that those who received a bonus were more likely to believe that gambling is relatively harmless and that it can be enjoyable.

This research provides some evidence that casino bonuses can lead to increased levels of gambling, particularly among people who are not already regular gamblers. It also suggests that casino bonuses could play a role in increasing support for gambling legalization. This is important because it could help to pave the way for more widespread legalisation of gambling across the United States.

At present, only a handful of states have legalized all forms of gambling, while many others have only legalized specific types of gambling (such as poker or horse racing). There are still many states where gambling is completely illegal. If casinos can use bonuses to convince more people that gambling is safe and enjoyable, then this could lead to increased pressure for legalization in these states.

While it is still too early to say for certain whether casino bonuses will lead to increased levels of legalization, this research provides some interesting insights into how they might change public opinion on this issue.

#  Pros and cons of legalizing gambling in New York debated as casino bonus looms

Casinos in New York State may soon offer a bonus to lure customers. The pro and cons of legalizing gambling are being hotly debated.

Supporters of legalizing gambling argue that it would be a financial boon to the state, bringing in millions in tax revenue. They also say that it would create jobs and that it is a harmless diversion for people who enjoy gambling.

Opponents of gambling argue that it is a wasteful way to spend money and that it leads to addiction and other social problems. They also point out that the state would not see nearly as much revenue from gambling as supporters claim, since most of the money goes to the casinos owners.

So, what are the pros and cons of legalizing gambling in New York? Here is a closer look at both sides of the argument:

PRO: Gambling can bring in significant tax revenue for the state.

CON: Gambling can be addictive and lead to other social problems.
