        <h1 id="Indiana-Becomes-First-State-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Indiana-Becomes-First-State-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Becomes First State to Legalize Online Sports Betting"></a>Indiana Becomes First State to Legalize Online Sports Betting</h1><p>Indiana became the first state to legalize online sports betting on Thursday, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in May that overturned a federal ban on the activity.</p>
<p>The law, which takes effect in October, allows bets to be placed on professional and collegiate sporting events. Indiana residents must be 21 years old or older to place a bet.</p>
<p>The state is expecting an influx of revenue from the new law; officials anticipate it will generate up to $50 million annually in taxes.</p>
<p>Indiana is not the only state moving to legalize online sports betting; Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and West Virginia are all considering similar laws.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Follows-Suit-Legalizing-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Nevada-Follows-Suit-Legalizing-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Follows Suit, Legalizing Online Sports Betting"></a>Nevada Follows Suit, Legalizing Online Sports Betting</h1><p>The state of Nevada finally followed through with the legalization of online sports betting on Tuesday, June 12th. This move comes in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in May to repeal the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. This legislation essentially outlawed sports betting across all states, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Nevada was one of those exceptions, as the state had long been allowed to offer sports betting within its borders. But with PASPA overturned, other states are now free to legalize sports betting as well. And that’s precisely what Nevada has done, although the process for doing so has been far from smooth.</p>
<p>In order to legalize online sports betting, the Nevada Gaming Commission had to approve a number of regulations first. These regulations stipulate everything from who is eligible to bet on sports to how bets can be placed. And although there was some initial opposition to these regulations, they ultimately passed late last month.</p>
<p>That paved the way for Nevadans to start placing bets on sports games via their phones or laptops starting on Tuesday. Residents can now head over to one of the state’s licensed sportsbooks and place a wager on just about any game they like.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions, of course. For example, you can’t bet on high school or college games, and you can only bet on major professional leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB. But for the most part, Nevadans are free to place bets on any game they please.</p>
<p>And that’s good news for the state’s gambling industry, which is already estimated to be worth $2 billion per year. With online sports betting now legal, that number is only expected to grow in coming years. In fact, analysts believe that online gambling could bring in an additional $1 billion per year in revenue for Nevada.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many casinos are already gearing up for this influx of new business. The MGM Resorts International casino chain has announced plans to offer mobile sports betting app later this year, while Caesars Entertainment is also expected to get into the game soon.</p>
<p>So far it seems that most Nevadans are embracing this new form of gambling. In fact, a recent poll found that two-thirds of residents approve of online sports betting. That figure is likely to continue rising in the coming weeks and months as people get a chance to try out this new form of gambling for themselves.</p>
<p>As more and more states legalize sports betting in light of PASPA’s repeal, it will be interesting see how things play out across the country. Will Nevada become the new mecca for gambling? Or will some other state usurp its crown? Only time will tell…</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-and-Pennsylvania-Join-the-Race-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#New-Jersey-and-Pennsylvania-Join-the-Race-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey and Pennsylvania Join the Race to Legalize Online Sports Betting"></a>New Jersey and Pennsylvania Join the Race to Legalize Online Sports Betting</h1><p>Two more states, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, have legalized online sports betting as the race to legalize the activity intensifies. New Jersey’s law went into effect on June 11, while Pennsylvania’s took effect on July 15.</p>
<p>The laws in both states allow for licensed operators to offer sports betting online and via mobile platforms to residents within the respective states. In New Jersey, wagers will be accepted on professional and collegiate sporting events, while Pennsylvania will also allow betting on high school games.</p>
<p>Sports gambling is a $150 billion industry in the United States, but has been illegal since 1992 when Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). PASPA prevented states other than Nevada from legalizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>In May 2018, however, the US Supreme Court ruled that PASPA was unconstitutional, opening the door for other states to legalize sports betting. Since then, Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Rhode Island, and West Virginia have all legalized some form of sports betting.</p>
<p>The rush to legalize online sports betting comes as no surprise as gaming companies look to tap into what is expected to be a lucrative market. MGM Resorts International has already announced plans to offer online sports betting in New Jersey through its PlayMGM brand, while Caesars Entertainment Corporation plans to do the same in Pennsylvania.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Becomes-Fourth-State-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Becomes-Fourth-State-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Becomes Fourth State to Legalize Online Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Becomes Fourth State to Legalize Online Sports Betting</h1><p>After a failed attempt to legalize sports betting in 2017, the state of Delaware has finally succeeded in legalizing the activity. On June 6th, 2018, Governor John Carney signed Senate Bill 265 into law, making Delaware the fourth state in the United States to allow online sports betting.</p>
<p>The new law allows casinos in Delaware to offer mobile and online sports betting to residents 21 years of age or older. Bettors will be able to place bets on sporting events from anywhere in the state, as long as they are within Delaware’s borders.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting is expected to bring an additional $7 million in revenue to Delaware annually. This money will be used to fund public education in the state. Additionally, the law creates a new Sports Wagering Oversight Committee, which will be responsible for regulating the industry and ensuring that players are treated fairly.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 265 passed both chambers of the Delaware legislature with bipartisan support. Supporters of the bill argue that it will create jobs and generate economic growth in the state. Critics say that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>Only three other states currently allow online sports betting: Nevada, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Pennsylvania is expected to legalize it soon, making it the fourth state with legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Poised-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting-in-light-of-Recent-Supreme-Court-Ruling"><a href="#More-States-Poised-to-Legalize-Online-Sports-Betting-in-light-of-Recent-Supreme-Court-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="More States Poised to Legalize Online Sports Betting in light of Recent Supreme Court Ruling"></a>More States Poised to Legalize Online Sports Betting in light of Recent Supreme Court Ruling</h1><p>This week, the US Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that had outlawed sports betting in most states. The decision could lead to a proliferation of legalized sports betting, with many states expected to move quickly to pass legislation authorizing it.</p>
<p>The court’s 6-3 ruling in favor of New Jersey said that the law — the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) — violated the Tenth Amendment by improperly forcing states to maintain prohibition on sports betting. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, “The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>New Jersey has been trying to overturn PASPA for years; after multiple failed attempts, the state finally succeeded in doing so with help from former New Jersey governor Chris Christie. In his concurring opinion on Monday’s ruling, Christie said that PASPA was “a direct violation of the Tenth Amendment” and that “the Constitution was drafted to protect individual liberty”.</p>
<p>Now that PASPA has been ruled unconstitutional, many other states are likely to legalize sports betting in order to generate new tax revenue. In addition, many casinos and gaming companies are expected to begin offering sports wagering services in order to take advantage of this new market opportunity.</p>
