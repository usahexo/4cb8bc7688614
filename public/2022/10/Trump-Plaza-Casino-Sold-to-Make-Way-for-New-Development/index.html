<p>The sale, announced Monday, comes as no surprise since the casino has been struggling for years. It will be the fifth Atlantic City casino to close in recent years.</p>
<p>The buyer, Meruelo Group, said it plans to build a new unspecified development on the site.</p>
<p>Atlantic City was once home to 12 casinos but now has just eight. The closures have cost thousands of jobs and taken a toll on the city’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Voila-Game-Who-Held-Trump-Plaza-Casino"><a href="#Voila-Game-Who-Held-Trump-Plaza-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Voila Game: Who Held Trump Plaza Casino?"></a>Voila Game: Who Held Trump Plaza Casino?</h1><p>The game is to identify who held the Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2014, Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka announced that they had sold the Trump Plaza Casino to the Meruelo Group. The casino had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice in recent years, and the Trumps were looking to get out of the casino business.</p>
<p>The Meruelo Group is a California-based company that owns a number of hotels and casinos, including the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno. It was formed by Alex Meruelo, who immigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1961.</p>
<p>The purchase of the Trump Plaza Casino was seen as a positive development for the Meruelo Group. The company planned to invest $70 million into refurbishing the casino and bringing it up to date. It also planned to keep all of the employees at the casino.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that Alex Meruelo had bought a casino in trouble. In 2012, he purchased The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, which had also gone bankrupt. He has plans to turn that casino around as well.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Plaza-Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-33-Years"><a href="#Trump-Plaza-Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-33-Years" class="headerlink" title="Trump Plaza Casino Closes its Doors after 33 Years"></a>Trump Plaza Casino Closes its Doors after 33 Years</h1><p>The Trump Plaza Casino closed its doors after 33 years in business. The closure leaves 3,000 employees out of work and is another hit to the city’s struggling casino industry.</p>
<p>The Atlantic City casino opened in 1984 with then-owner Donald Trump boasting that it was “the biggest, the best, and the most beautiful” facility of its kind. But it has been struggling in recent years as gambling revenues have declined in the state.</p>
<p>In February, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy for the fourth time, citing increasing competition from casinos in neighboring states.</p>
<p>In a statement, company officials said they made a “difficult decision” to close the casino, but it was necessary to preserve its other two properties in the city.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza will officially close on September 16th.</p>
<h1 id="Remembering-the-Good-Times-at-Trump-Plaza-Casino"><a href="#Remembering-the-Good-Times-at-Trump-Plaza-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Remembering the Good Times at Trump Plaza Casino"></a>Remembering the Good Times at Trump Plaza Casino</h1><p>It has been a little over a year since the Trump Plaza Casino closed its doors for good. The iconic casino, which was once a favorite of both locals and tourists, quickly became an afterthought in the ever-growing Atlantic City casino market.</p>
<p>Like any great memory, the thoughts of the good times spent at Trump Plaza bring a smile to my face. Although I only frequented the casino for dinner and a show, it always felt like a special treat.</p>
<p>The standout attraction at Trump Plaza was undoubtedly its elegant design. From the moment you walked through the front doors, you were greeted by sparkling chandeliers and plush carpets. The lavish decor was mirrored in the many high-end shops that lined the casino floor.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement was the world-class entertainment that was on display each and every night. I can still remember seeing names like Elton John, Rod Stewart, and Celine Dion perform live on stage. It was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience!</p>
<p>Even though it’s been years since I set foot in Trump Plaza Casino, its memories remain fondly etched in my mind. I’m sure others who had the chance to experience it will feel exactly the same way.</p>
<h1 id="The-End-of-an-Era-Trump-Plaza-Casino-Shutters-its-Doors"><a href="#The-End-of-an-Era-Trump-Plaza-Casino-Shutters-its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="The End of an Era: Trump Plaza Casino Shutters its Doors"></a>The End of an Era: Trump Plaza Casino Shutters its Doors</h1><p>The Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey closed its doors for good on Tuesday, September 16th, 2014. This marks the end of an era as it was the fourth and final casino in Atlantic City to close this year.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza was opened in 1984 by Donald Trump and his then-wife Ivana. At the time, it was seen as a symbol of luxury and opulence. However, over the years, it has fallen into disrepair and filed for bankruptcy twice.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Trump Entertainment Resorts, the company said that “the closing of Trump Plaza is another attempt by the STAYMAKERS to destroy competition in Atlantic City through attrition.”</p>
<p>Atlantic City has been struggling for years now as neighboring states have begun to offer more gambling options. In February of this year, Revel Casino Hotel – the only new casino built in Atlantic City since 2007 – filed for bankruptcy and announced plans to close. The Showboat Casino Hotel closed its doors in late August and the Trump Taj Mahal is scheduled to close at the end of November if a buyer cannot be found.</p>
<p>The loss of these four casinos will leave 10,000 employees out of work and deal a significant blow to Atlantic City’s economy.</p>
