There are a number of offshore casinos that can be found up and down the state line, with more than half of them being located in the Reno-Sparks area.</p>
<p>These offshore casinos offer a variety of games, including table games, slots, and poker. They also offer some tasty food options and often have great drink specials. Plus, they don’t require any sort of membership or entry fees.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun night out gaming with your friends, look no further than Nevada’s offshore casinos. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Second-in-the-Nation-for-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Delaware-Second-in-the-Nation-for-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Second in the Nation for Offshore Gaming"></a>Delaware Second in the Nation for Offshore Gaming</h1><p>Delaware is one of the United States of America’s fifty states. It is located in the Northeastern region of the country and borders Pennsylvania to the north and Maryland to the west. The state has three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex.</p>
<p>Delaware is often referred to as the “First State” because it was the first colony to ratify the Constitution of the United States in 1787. The state also has a long history of offshore gaming. In fact, Delaware is currently second in the nation for offshore gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The majority of Delaware’s offshore gaming revenue comes from internet gaming operations. These include online poker, casino games, and sports betting. The state legalized internet gaming in 2012 and currently has over 60 licensed operators.</p>
<p>Revenue from internet gaming operations accounts for over 60% of Delaware’s total offshore gaming revenue. This strong performance has helped Delaware become one of the most successful states in terms of online gambling revenues. In 2017, its online gambling industry generated over $60 million in gross revenue.</p>
<p>This success can be attributed to a number of factors including:</p>
<p>-A well-developed regulatory framework that ensures compliance with state and federal laws;<br>-A relatively small population (less than 1 million people); and<br>-The presence of large casinos like Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway which offer online gambling services.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-and-Florida-Rank-Third-and-Fourth-for-Offshore-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-and-Florida-Rank-Third-and-Fourth-for-Offshore-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey and Florida Rank Third and Fourth for Offshore Gambling"></a>New Jersey and Florida Rank Third and Fourth for Offshore Gambling</h1><p>According to the latest research from National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), New Jersey and Florida rank third and fourth for offshore gambling. Gambling losses totaled $2.9 billion in the two states in 2016, with New Jersey accounting for $1.9 billion of that figure and Florida taking in $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>The NCPG study found that 43 percent of all gambling revenue in the U.S. comes from offshore sites, with $45.8 billion wagered in 2016. The council’s executive director Keith Whyte said the findings underscore the need for more responsible gambling programs nationwide. “As our report shows, offshore gambling is a major problem that is expanding rapidly,” Whyte said in a statement. “It is critical that we address this issue now before it gets even worse.”</p>
<p>The council’s report also cited a study by the University of Nevada at Reno that found 79 percent of people who gambled online did so on unlicensed offshore websites, which often have fewer consumer protections than licensed domestic sites. The Reno study also found that 82 percent of people who gambled on sports did so on unlicensed offshore websites, where they are more likely to encounter scams and frauds.</p>
<p>Offshore gambling has come under increased scrutiny in recent years as concerns about its impact on consumers have mounted. In March 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a sweeping indictment of several online gambling companies, accusing them of violating federal law and cheating Americans out of millions of dollars. The companies named in the indictment included three of the largest poker sites in the world: PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker.</p>
<p>Sessions accused the companies of violating the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) by processing payments for illegal bets made by U.S. residents. He also alleged that they had defrauded customers out of millions of dollars by manipulating games and withholding winnings. “This Department will not tolerate internet gambling companies who prey on American citizens,” Sessions said at the time.</p>
<p>The indictments led to a crackdown on several prominent offshore poker sites, including most notably PokerStars, which was forced to shut down its U.S.-facing operations indefinitely. Several other large operators soon followed suit, pulling out of the American market altogether. While some sites have since re-entered the U.S., traffic remains well below pre-crackdown levels</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Ranks-Fifth-for-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Louisiana-Ranks-Fifth-for-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Ranks Fifth for Offshore Gaming"></a>Louisiana Ranks Fifth for Offshore Gaming</h1><p>Louisiana ranks fifth for offshore gaming operations, according to a report from Louisiana Economic Development (LED).</p>
<p>The report, “2019 Markets &amp; Gaming: The State of Play,” found that the state has 14 offshore gaming licenses holders, who generated a total of $1.8 billion in revenue in 2018. That put Louisiana behind Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania in terms of revenue.</p>
<p>“The gaming industry is a vital sector of our economy and supports thousands of jobs across the state,” LED Secretary Don Pierson said. “Our goal is to make Louisiana the most competitive gaming destination in the country by creating an environment where businesses can thrive. This report underscores the significant impact our gaming industry has on our economy and provides a roadmap for future growth.”</p>
<p>The report also found that the industry employs more than 12,000 people in Louisiana and generated $236 million in taxes last year.</p>
<p>Offshore gaming includes casinos that are located outside of state boundaries and licensed to operate in Louisiana. The casinos are often located on ships or barges that travel in international waters.</p>
<h1 id="Which-States-Enable-Off-Shore-Gambling"><a href="#Which-States-Enable-Off-Shore-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Which States Enable Off Shore Gambling?"></a>Which States Enable Off Shore Gambling?</h1><p>There are a number of states in the US that enable gambling to take place off shore. These states include Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey. There are a number of benefits to having off shore gambling in these states.</p>
<p>The first benefit is that it enables casinos to offer a wider range of games. This is because they are not restricted by the same laws as land-based casinos. Offering a wider range of games means that they can attract more players and increase their profits.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that off shore gambling can help to create jobs. This is because it enables casinos to hire more staff and it also encourages tourism. In fact, research has shown that off shore gambling can generate up to $1 billion in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Finally, off shore gambling can help to boost the economy of the state. This is because it generates tax revenue which can be used for public services such as education and healthcare.</p>
