        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-the-Nation-in-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads the Nation in Offshore Gaming"></a>Nevada Leads the Nation in Offshore Gaming</h1><p>In Nevada, casinos aren’t just limited to the Las Vegas Strip. There are a number of offshore casinos that can be found up and down the state line, with more than half of them being located in the Reno-Sparks area.</p>
<p>These offshore casinos offer a variety of games, including table games, slots, and poker. They also offer some tasty food options and often have great drink specials. Plus, they don’t require any sort of membership or entry fees.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun night out gaming with your friends, look no further than Nevada’s offshore casinos. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Second-in-the-Nation-for-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Delaware-Second-in-the-Nation-for-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Second in the Nation for Offshore Gaming"></a>Delaware Second in the Nation for Offshore Gaming</h1><p>Delaware is one of the United States of America’s fifty states. It is located in the Northeastern region of the country and borders Pennsylvania to the north and Maryland to the west. The state has three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex.</p>
<p>Delaware is often referred to as the “First State” because it was the first colony to ratify the Constitution of the United States in 1787. The state also has a long history of offshore gaming. In fact, Delaware is currently second in the nation for offshore gaming revenue.</p>
<p>The majority of Delaware’s offshore gaming revenue comes from internet gaming operations. These include online poker, casino games, and sports betting. The state legalized internet gaming in 2012 and currently has over 60 licensed operators.</p>
<p>Revenue from internet gaming operations accounts for over 60% of Delaware’s total offshore gaming revenue. This strong performance has helped Delaware become one of the most successful states in terms of online gambling revenues. In 2017, its online gambling industry generated over $60 million in gross revenue.</p>
<p>This success can be attributed to a number of factors including:</p>
<p>-A well-developed regulatory framework that ensures compliance with state and federal laws;<br>-A relatively small population (less than 1 million people); and<br>-The presence of large casinos like Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway which offer online gambling services.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-and-Florida-Rank-Third-and-Fourth-for-Offshore-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-and-Florida-Rank-Third-and-Fourth-for-Offshore-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey and Florida Rank Third and Fourth for Offshore Gambling"></a>New Jersey and Florida Rank Third and Fourth for Offshore Gambling</h1><p>According to the latest research from National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), New Jersey and Florida rank third and fourth for offshore gambling. Gambling losses totaled $2.9 billion in the two states in 2016, with New Jersey accounting for $1.9 billion of that figure and Florida taking in $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>The NCPG study found that 43 percent of all gambling revenue in the U.S. comes from offshore sites, with $45.8 billion wagered in 2016. The council’s executive director Keith Whyte said the findings underscore the need for more responsible gambling programs nationwide. “As our report shows, offshore gambling is a major problem that is expanding rapidly,” Whyte said in a statement. “It is critical that we address this issue now before it gets even worse.”</p>
<p>The council’s report also cited a study by the University of Nevada at Reno that found 79 percent of people who gambled online did so on unlicensed offshore websites, which often have fewer consumer protections than licensed domestic sites. The Reno study also found that 82 percent of people who gambled on sports did so on unlicensed offshore websites, where they are more likely to encounter scams and frauds.</p>
<p>Offshore gambling has come under increased scrutiny in recent years as concerns about its impact on consumers have mounted. In March 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a sweeping indictment of several online gambling companies, accusing them of violating federal law and cheating Americans out of millions of dollars. The companies named in the indictment included three of the largest poker sites in the world: PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker.</p>
<p>Sessions accused the companies of violating the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) by processing payments for illegal bets made by U.S. residents. He also alleged that they had defrauded customers out of millions of dollars by manipulating games and withholding winnings. “This Department will not tolerate internet gambling companies who prey on American citizens,” Sessions said at the time.</p>
<p>The indictments led to a crackdown on several prominent offshore poker sites, including most notably PokerStars, which was forced to shut down its U.S.-facing operations indefinitely. Several other large operators soon followed suit, pulling out of the American market altogether. While some sites have since re-entered the U.S., traffic remains well below pre-crackdown levels</p>
<h1 id="Louisiana-Ranks-Fifth-for-Offshore-Gaming"><a href="#Louisiana-Ranks-Fifth-for-Offshore-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Louisiana Ranks Fifth for Offshore Gaming"></a>Louisiana Ranks Fifth for Offshore Gaming</h1><p>Louisiana ranks fifth for offshore gaming operations, according to a report from Louisiana Economic Development (LED).</p>
<p>The report, “2019 Markets &amp; Gaming: The State of Play,” found that the state has 14 offshore gaming licenses holders, who generated a total of $1.8 billion in revenue in 2018. That put Louisiana behind Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania in terms of revenue.</p>
<p>“The gaming industry is a vital sector of our economy and supports thousands of jobs across the state,” LED Secretary Don Pierson said. “Our goal is to make Louisiana the most competitive gaming destination in the country by creating an environment where businesses can thrive. This report underscores the significant impact our gaming industry has on our economy and provides a roadmap for future growth.”</p>
<p>The report also found that the industry employs more than 12,000 people in Louisiana and generated $236 million in taxes last year.</p>
<p>Offshore gaming includes casinos that are located outside of state boundaries and licensed to operate in Louisiana. The casinos are often located on ships or barges that travel in international waters.</p>
<h1 id="Which-States-Enable-Off-Shore-Gambling"><a href="#Which-States-Enable-Off-Shore-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Which States Enable Off Shore Gambling?"></a>Which States Enable Off Shore Gambling?</h1><p>There are a number of states in the US that enable gambling to take place off shore. These states include Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey. There are a number of benefits to having off shore gambling in these states.</p>
<p>The first benefit is that it enables casinos to offer a wider range of games. This is because they are not restricted by the same laws as land-based casinos. Offering a wider range of games means that they can attract more players and increase their profits.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that off shore gambling can help to create jobs. This is because it enables casinos to hire more staff and it also encourages tourism. In fact, research has shown that off shore gambling can generate up to $1 billion in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Finally, off shore gambling can help to boost the economy of the state. This is because it generates tax revenue which can be used for public services such as education and healthcare.</p>

However, supporting someone with a gambling addiction can be difficult, especially if we don’t know how to best assist them in their recovery.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how you can support your partner who is battling a gambling addiction, here are some expert tips from addiction specialists:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t enable their behavior. This means that you should avoid giving them money to gamble with, or making any other accommodations that will make it easier for them to continue their addictive behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Help them to create healthy boundaries. Gambling can be an incredibly isolating activity, so encourage your partner to socialize and participate in activities that aren’t related to gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Educate yourself about gambling addiction. The more you know about the signs and symptoms of this type of addiction, the better equipped you will be to support your partner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek professional help. If you feel like you’re not able to provide the level of support your partner needs, don’t hesitate to seek professional assistance. There are many qualified therapists who specialize in gambling addiction treatment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient and understanding. Recovery from a gambling addiction can be a long and difficult process, so be patient and supportive as your partner works through it.</p>

You are not alone. Gambling addiction can be a very challenging problem for both the individual and the family. There are ways you can help your spouse overcome gambling addiction and rebuild your relationship.</p>
<ol>
<li>Seek professional help.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to seek professional help. A therapist who specializes in gambling addiction can provide guidance and support for both of you. He or she can also provide tools and strategies for overcoming gambling addiction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create a support network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Create a support network of friends or family members who will be there for both of you as you work through this difficult time. These people can offer emotional support and practical assistance, such as babysitting so you can attend counseling sessions together or driving your spouse to Gamblers Anonymous meetings.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Establish boundaries.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most important things you can do to help your spouse is to establish boundaries around gambling behavior. This means setting rules about how much money can be gambled, how often gambling can occur, and what types of gambling are allowed. It’s important to be clear about these rules and stick to them firmly, even if your spouse protests or tries to push the boundaries.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Keep track of expenses.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also important to keep track of your spouse’s expenses related to gambling. This includes tracking how much money is spent on gambling as well as any money that is lost or won while gambling. Keeping track of these expenses will help you understand the extent of the problem and make it easier to set realistic goals for reducing or eliminating spending on gambling altogether.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Help manage finances.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-Cope-When-Your-Partner-Has-a-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#How-to-Cope-When-Your-Partner-Has-a-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="How to Cope When Your Partner Has a Gambling Addiction"></a>How to Cope When Your Partner Has a Gambling Addiction</h1><p>When you are in a relationship with someone who has a gambling addiction, it can be difficult to know how to cope. You may feel like you are constantly walking on eggshells, trying not to upset them or make them feel guilty. You may also feel like you are constantly the one who is responsible for cleaning up the messes that their addiction leaves behind.</p>
<p>If your partner has a gambling addiction, there are some things that you can do to help cope with the situation. First, it is important to set some boundaries. You need to be realistic about what you can and cannot do in order to help your partner. If they are unwilling or unable to work on their addiction, then you may need to distance yourself from them. This can be difficult, but it is important for your own wellbeing.</p>
<p>You also need to take care of yourself emotionally and mentally. It is normal to feel overwhelmed and stressed out when you are in a relationship with someone who has a gambling addiction. Seek out support from friends and family members, and don’t be afraid to talk about what you are going through. It can also be helpful to journal about your experiences or attend therapy sessions.</p>
<p>Finally, try not to blame yourself for your partner’s addiction. It is not your fault, and you cannot control their behavior. Remember that you are not responsible for their actions. They are responsible for their own recovery process.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-Do-If-You-Suspect-Your-Spouse-Has-a-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#What-to-Do-If-You-Suspect-Your-Spouse-Has-a-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="What to Do If You Suspect Your Spouse Has a Gambling Addiction"></a>What to Do If You Suspect Your Spouse Has a Gambling Addiction</h1><p>If you suspect your spouse has a gambling addiction, there are some important steps you should take. Here are five of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to Your Spouse About the Problem</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to talk to your spouse about the problem. This can be a difficult conversation, but it’s important that you both be honest with each other. If your spouse is willing to admit that they have a gambling addiction and is willing to get help, then you can start working on a plan together.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Get Help for Yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>If your spouse isn’t willing to admit that they have a problem or refuses to get help, then you need to focus on getting help for yourself. There are many resources available for spouses of gamblers, and it’s important for you to take care of yourself emotionally and mentally during this time.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Establish Ground Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve both acknowledged the problem and started getting help, it’s important to establish ground rules. These rules should include things like how much money your spouse is allowed to gamble each week and what kind of activities they can participate in outside of work. Be sure to enforce these rules so that your spouse knows that you are serious about getting them help.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seek Professional Help</li>
</ol>
<p>If the problem continues or gets worse, it’s time to seek professional help. There are many therapists who specialize in helping spouses of addicts, and they can provide you with the support and guidance you need during this difficult time.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Take Care of Yourself Emotionally and Physically</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it’s important for you to take care of yourself emotionally and physically during this time. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep and eating healthy foods, and try to find ways to relax and de-stress. Taking care of yourself will help you stay strong during this difficult process.”</p>

<li><p>It’s important that you first understand what a gambling addiction is. A gambling addiction is defined as an impulse-control disorder in which individuals recurrently gamble in spite of negative consequences. This means that even though your partner may be aware that they are risking too much money or they are getting into debt, they continue to gamble regardless. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be supportive and understanding towards your partner. This can be a difficult time for both of you, and it’s important to remember to take care of yourself as well. Try not to get angry or frustrated with your partner, as this will only make things worse. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek professional help for your partner. Gambling addictions can be extremely difficult to overcome on your own, and professional help can provide the necessary support and guidance. There are many qualified professionals who specialize in gambling addiction treatment, so don’t be afraid to ask for help. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Help create a healthy environment for your partner. This may include setting rules about how much money can be gambled each day&#x2F;week, removing access to gambling websites&#x2F;apps, and avoiding any situations that may trigger gambling urges. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be patient and remain supportive throughout the entire recovery process. Recovery from a gambling addiction can take time, but with patience and support, it is definitely possible.</p>

        <h1 id="Atlantic-City-casino-bonus-offers-may-help-boost-New-York-gambling-industry"><a href="#Atlantic-City-casino-bonus-offers-may-help-boost-New-York-gambling-industry" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City casino bonus offers may help boost New York gambling industry"></a>Atlantic City casino bonus offers may help boost New York gambling industry</h1><p>Atlantic City casino bonus offers may help boost New York gambling industry, as state officials look to expand gaming options in the Empire State.</p>
<p>According to a recent report in the <em>New York Post</em>, lawmakers are weighing a proposal that would allow up to seven new casinos to open in New York, with at least one of those facilities located in the New York City area. The measure is seen as a way to help shore up the state’s struggling gambling industry, which has seen revenues decline in recent years.</p>
<p>Casino bonus offers could play a role in boosting New York gambling industry revenues. In addition to the possibility of new casinos, lawmakers are also considering expanding gambling options at existing venues, including racetracks and OTBs (off-track betting locations). This could include introducing new games such as poker and blackjack, as well as permitting video lottery terminals (VLTs) at additional locations.</p>
<p>The potential for expanded gambling in New York has already sparked interest from casino operators, including MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Both companies have reportedly expressed an interest in building new casinos in the Empire State.</p>
<p>If approved, the expansion of gambling in New York would come on the heels of similar moves in other states. In Massachusetts, for example, lawmakers are currently considering a proposal that would allow up to three resort-style casinos and one slots parlor to open in the Bay State. And just last week, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed a bill allowing for construction of up to 10 new casinos across the state.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Bonus-New-York-Lawmakers-Propose-Gambling-Expansion"><a href="#Casino-Bonus-New-York-Lawmakers-Propose-Gambling-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="Casino Bonus: New York Lawmakers Propose Gambling Expansion"></a>Casino Bonus: New York Lawmakers Propose Gambling Expansion</h1><p>Casino Bonus</p>
<p>New York lawmakers have recently proposed a gambling expansion bill that would allow for the construction of new casinos in the state. The proposal was announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday and it is said that the measure would bring in $1.5 billion in new revenue for the state. In addition, the bill would also allow for the expansion of racetracks with video lottery terminals and it would also legalize online poker.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo commented on the proposal, stating that it would “bring jobs and economic growth to upstate New York”. He went on to say that the measure is part of his broader goal to create a “second economic revolution” in upstate New York. The proposal has already been met with some criticism, however, as opponents argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>If approved, the measure would allow for six new casinos to be built in different areas of upstate New York. The casinos would be located in Albany, Binghamton, Elmira, Niagara Falls, Syracuse, and Troy. In addition, four existing racetracks with video lottery terminals would be allowed to expand their operations. Finally, online poker would be legalized in the state under the new proposal.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. They note that casino gambling is already prevalent in New York and that this measure would simply allow for more casinos to be constructed. Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates. They also note that there are already many casinos located in New York and that this measure will only serve to cannibalize business from those establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Upstate-New-York-casinos-see-potential-in-legalized-gambling"><a href="#Upstate-New-York-casinos-see-potential-in-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Upstate New York casinos see potential in legalized gambling"></a>Upstate New York casinos see potential in legalized gambling</h1><p>Albany, NY - There is big potential for upstate New York casinos, as the state moves closer to legalizing gambling.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow for seven new full-scale casinos to be built in Upstate New York. The amendment would also allow for 40 new mini-casinos, or racinos, to be built across the state.</p>
<p>Cuomo said that the amendment would bring in $1 billion in new revenue to the state each year. He cited studies that showed that legalized gambling would create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity statewide.</p>
<p>“It is time to bringing this economic development opportunity to Upstate New York,” Cuomo said. “This proposal will create jobs and generate billions of dollars for our economy.”</p>
<p>The amendment needs to be approved by the legislature in two successive sessions and then by voters in a referendum. The earliest it could go before voters is November 2019.</p>
<p>Casino operators are already expressing interest in building casinos in Upstate New York. MGM Resorts has already announced plans to build a casino resort in Sullivan County, while Caesars Entertainment has said it is interested in building a casino in Schenectady County.</p>
<p>Others are more cautious about the potential of legalized gambling. Upstate New York Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Heather Briccetti said that the chamber wants to see more details about the proposal before taking a position on it.</p>
<p>“There are certainly pros and cons to any type of development project, and we want to make sure that any expansion of gaming includes opportunities for businesses throughout all regions of the state,” Briccetti said.</p>
<h1 id="Could-casino-bonus-lead-to-legalization-of-gambling-in-New-York"><a href="#Could-casino-bonus-lead-to-legalization-of-gambling-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="Could casino bonus lead to legalization of gambling in New York?"></a>Could casino bonus lead to legalization of gambling in New York?</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has found that introducing a bonus for casino players could lead to an increase in the legalization of gambling across the United States. The study, which was published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, looked at how different casino bonuses influenced people’s attitudes towards gambling and their intention to gamble in the future.</p>
<p>The researchers found that people who received a bonus were more likely to have a positive attitude towards gambling and to be more likely to gamble in the future. In fact, the study showed that around 60% of those who received a bonus said they were likely to gamble in the future, compared to just 40% of those who didn’t receive a bonus. The researchers also found that those who received a bonus were more likely to believe that gambling is relatively harmless and that it can be enjoyable.</p>
<p>This research provides some evidence that casino bonuses can lead to increased levels of gambling, particularly among people who are not already regular gamblers. It also suggests that casino bonuses could play a role in increasing support for gambling legalization. This is important because it could help to pave the way for more widespread legalisation of gambling across the United States.</p>
<p>At present, only a handful of states have legalized all forms of gambling, while many others have only legalized specific types of gambling (such as poker or horse racing). There are still many states where gambling is completely illegal. If casinos can use bonuses to convince more people that gambling is safe and enjoyable, then this could lead to increased pressure for legalization in these states.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to say for certain whether casino bonuses will lead to increased levels of legalization, this research provides some interesting insights into how they might change public opinion on this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Pros-and-cons-of-legalizing-gambling-in-New-York-debated-as-casino-bonus-looms"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-legalizing-gambling-in-New-York-debated-as-casino-bonus-looms" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of legalizing gambling in New York debated as casino bonus looms"></a>Pros and cons of legalizing gambling in New York debated as casino bonus looms</h1><p>Casinos in New York State may soon offer a bonus to lure customers. The pro and cons of legalizing gambling are being hotly debated.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalizing gambling argue that it would be a financial boon to the state, bringing in millions in tax revenue. They also say that it would create jobs and that it is a harmless diversion for people who enjoy gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of gambling argue that it is a wasteful way to spend money and that it leads to addiction and other social problems. They also point out that the state would not see nearly as much revenue from gambling as supporters claim, since most of the money goes to the casinos owners.</p>
<p>So, what are the pros and cons of legalizing gambling in New York? Here is a closer look at both sides of the argument:</p>
<p>PRO: Gambling can bring in significant tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>CON: Gambling can be addictive and lead to other social problems.</p>

In blackjack, players attempt to draw cards that total 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the player goes over 21, they “bust” and lose the hand. The goal is to draw cards that will give you a total that is closer to 21 than the dealer’s total without going over.</p>
<p>If you’re new to blackjack, there are a few things you should know before getting started. First,dealers always hit on soft 17 (a hand that includes an Ace and 6). This means that they will always take another card if their total is 17, regardless of whether the next card would give them a total of 18 or more. Second, players can split pairs (two cards of the same rank) once per hand. When you split a pair, you must place another bet equal to your original bet. The dealer then gives each player two cards, one face up and one face down. You play each card separately and can either hit (take another card) or stand (stay with the current total). If both cards in the split hand are counted as 10s (or any other two-card combination), then players are usually allowed to re-split, allowing them to play three hands at once.

        <h1 id="Trump-Plaza-Casino-Sold-to-Make-Way-for-New-Development"><a href="#Trump-Plaza-Casino-Sold-to-Make-Way-for-New-Development" class="headerlink" title="Trump Plaza Casino Sold to Make Way for New Development"></a>Trump Plaza Casino Sold to Make Way for New Development</h1><p>Atlantic City’s Trump Plaza casino has been sold to a California investment group that plans to demolish it and build a new development in its place.</p>
<p>The sale, announced Monday, comes as no surprise since the casino has been struggling for years. It will be the fifth Atlantic City casino to close in recent years.</p>
<p>The buyer, Meruelo Group, said it plans to build a new unspecified development on the site.</p>
<p>Atlantic City was once home to 12 casinos but now has just eight. The closures have cost thousands of jobs and taken a toll on the city’s economy.</p>
<h1 id="Voila-Game-Who-Held-Trump-Plaza-Casino"><a href="#Voila-Game-Who-Held-Trump-Plaza-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Voila Game: Who Held Trump Plaza Casino?"></a>Voila Game: Who Held Trump Plaza Casino?</h1><p>The game is to identify who held the Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2014, Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka announced that they had sold the Trump Plaza Casino to the Meruelo Group. The casino had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice in recent years, and the Trumps were looking to get out of the casino business.</p>
<p>The Meruelo Group is a California-based company that owns a number of hotels and casinos, including the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno. It was formed by Alex Meruelo, who immigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1961.</p>
<p>The purchase of the Trump Plaza Casino was seen as a positive development for the Meruelo Group. The company planned to invest $70 million into refurbishing the casino and bringing it up to date. It also planned to keep all of the employees at the casino.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that Alex Meruelo had bought a casino in trouble. In 2012, he purchased The Atlantic Club Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, which had also gone bankrupt. He has plans to turn that casino around as well.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-Plaza-Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-33-Years"><a href="#Trump-Plaza-Casino-Closes-its-Doors-after-33-Years" class="headerlink" title="Trump Plaza Casino Closes its Doors after 33 Years"></a>Trump Plaza Casino Closes its Doors after 33 Years</h1><p>The Trump Plaza Casino closed its doors after 33 years in business. The closure leaves 3,000 employees out of work and is another hit to the city’s struggling casino industry.</p>
<p>The Atlantic City casino opened in 1984 with then-owner Donald Trump boasting that it was “the biggest, the best, and the most beautiful” facility of its kind. But it has been struggling in recent years as gambling revenues have declined in the state.</p>
<p>In February, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy for the fourth time, citing increasing competition from casinos in neighboring states.</p>
<p>In a statement, company officials said they made a “difficult decision” to close the casino, but it was necessary to preserve its other two properties in the city.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza will officially close on September 16th.</p>
<h1 id="Remembering-the-Good-Times-at-Trump-Plaza-Casino"><a href="#Remembering-the-Good-Times-at-Trump-Plaza-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Remembering the Good Times at Trump Plaza Casino"></a>Remembering the Good Times at Trump Plaza Casino</h1><p>It has been a little over a year since the Trump Plaza Casino closed its doors for good. The iconic casino, which was once a favorite of both locals and tourists, quickly became an afterthought in the ever-growing Atlantic City casino market.</p>
<p>Like any great memory, the thoughts of the good times spent at Trump Plaza bring a smile to my face. Although I only frequented the casino for dinner and a show, it always felt like a special treat.</p>
<p>The standout attraction at Trump Plaza was undoubtedly its elegant design. From the moment you walked through the front doors, you were greeted by sparkling chandeliers and plush carpets. The lavish decor was mirrored in the many high-end shops that lined the casino floor.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement was the world-class entertainment that was on display each and every night. I can still remember seeing names like Elton John, Rod Stewart, and Celine Dion perform live on stage. It was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience!</p>
<p>Even though it’s been years since I set foot in Trump Plaza Casino, its memories remain fondly etched in my mind. I’m sure others who had the chance to experience it will feel exactly the same way.</p>
<h1 id="The-End-of-an-Era-Trump-Plaza-Casino-Shutters-its-Doors"><a href="#The-End-of-an-Era-Trump-Plaza-Casino-Shutters-its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="The End of an Era: Trump Plaza Casino Shutters its Doors"></a>The End of an Era: Trump Plaza Casino Shutters its Doors</h1><p>The Trump Plaza Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey closed its doors for good on Tuesday, September 16th, 2014. This marks the end of an era as it was the fourth and final casino in Atlantic City to close this year.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza was opened in 1984 by Donald Trump and his then-wife Ivana. At the time, it was seen as a symbol of luxury and opulence. However, over the years, it has fallen into disrepair and filed for bankruptcy twice.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Trump Entertainment Resorts, the company said that “the closing of Trump Plaza is another attempt by the STAYMAKERS to destroy competition in Atlantic City through attrition.”</p>
<p>Atlantic City has been struggling for years now as neighboring states have begun to offer more gambling options. In February of this year, Revel Casino Hotel – the only new casino built in Atlantic City since 2007 – filed for bankruptcy and announced plans to close. The Showboat Casino Hotel closed its doors in late August and the Trump Taj Mahal is scheduled to close at the end of November if a buyer cannot be found.</p>
<p>The loss of these four casinos will leave 10,000 employees out of work and deal a significant blow to Atlantic City’s economy.</p>
